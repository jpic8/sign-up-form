This is my attempt at the Sign-up Form from The Odin Project:

This was a fun project that I used basic HTML and CSS for. I probably should have used Webpack to bundle everything together given the images and font, but wanted to get this up asap so maybe next time. Had a lot of fun messing around with CSS here and think I've made some pretty good progress with regard to flexbox.
